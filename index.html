👨🏼  Welcome

This site hosts Jupyter-based discussion of technical topics of interest, emphasized with data and problems borrowed mainly from computational biology.

📚 I'm currently working toward the M.S. Computational Biology ('21) at Carnegie Mellon University 🏛️

🧬 My projects skew toward bioclinical natural language processing and computer vision 📉

See my [GitHub](https://github.com/simonlevine) for (more) code.
