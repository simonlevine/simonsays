Originally from northern California, I completed my B.A. in biolical sciences with a minor in mathematical finance at the University of Southern California.

I then spent about a year working in healthcare consulting and briefly worked at a winery. After spending a considerable amount of time and effort on the law school admissions test (LSAT), I realized the profession was not for me and instead chose to move into a master's program in computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University.

At CMU, I've worked toward mastering an understanding of statistical and deep learning methods as they relate to the biosciences. Some of my favorite coursework includes 02-710: Computational Genomics, and the infamous 11-785: Deep Learning.
