Originally from a small town in northern California, I completed my B.A. in biological sciences with a minor in mathematical finance at the University of Southern California.

I then spent about a year in consulting and briefly worked at a winery. I also devoted a considerable amount of time and effort on the law school admissions test (LSAT) but realized the profession was not for me. Instead, I chose to return toward technical topics and decided to pursue the master's program in computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University.

Since then, I've worked toward mastering an understanding of statistical and deep learning methods as they relate to the biosciences. Some of my favorite coursework includes *02-710: Computational Genomics*, and the infamous *11-785: Deep Learning*.
