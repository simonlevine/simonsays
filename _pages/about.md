Originally from a small town in northern California, I completed my B.A. in Biological Sciences with a minor in Mathematical Finance at the University of Southern California.

I then spent about a year in consulting and briefly worked making wine. I also devoted a considerable amount of time and effort on the law school admissions test (LSAT) before deciding the profession was not for me. Instead, I chose to return toward technical topics and decided to pursue the master's program in computational biology at Carnegie Mellon University.

Now, I'll be working as a Data Scientist at Encoded Therapeutics beginning June, 2021.
